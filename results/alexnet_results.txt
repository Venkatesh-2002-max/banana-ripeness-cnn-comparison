AlexNet – Banana Ripeness Detection Results
==========================================

Model Architecture:
- AlexNet (Deep Convolutional Neural Network)
- Input Image Size: 224 × 224 × 3
- Number of Classes: 4
  (Unripe, Ripe, Overripe, Rotten)

Training Configuration:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 0.0001
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Batch Size: 32
- Number of Epochs: 15
- Data Normalization: Rescale (1/255)

Dataset Details:
- Training Images: 11,793
- Validation Images: 1,123
- Test Images: 562

Performance Metrics:
- Final Training Accuracy: ~97.6%
- Final Validation Accuracy: ~95.1%
- Test Accuracy: 93.42%
- Test Loss: 0.1817

Observations:
- AlexNet achieved higher accuracy compared to LeNet.
- Deep convolutional layers enabled better feature extraction.
- Model showed strong generalization on unseen test data.
- Training time was significantly higher due to large number of parameters (~46 million).

Remarks:
- AlexNet provides improved classification performance at the cost of increased
  computational complexity and memory usage.
- Results are suitable for comparative analysis with other CNN architectures.
