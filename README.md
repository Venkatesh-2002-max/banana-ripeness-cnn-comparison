# Banana Ripeness Detection – CNN Comparison

This repository presents a comparative study of multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures
for banana ripeness detection using image classification.

## CNN Models Used
- LeNet
- AlexNet
- VGG16
- MobileNetV2

## Dataset
- Banana Ripeness Classification Dataset
- Classes: Unripe, Ripe, Overripe, Rotten
- Same dataset split used for all models

## Objective
To indicate and compare the performance of different CNN architectures
using accuracy metrics, without claiming superiority of any single model.
